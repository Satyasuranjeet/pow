            In near-future New Orleans, a mysterious distributor offers a free supply of <br>
            "Power"‚Äîa pill that grants various superpowers for five minutes‚Äîto a group of drug dealers, <br>
             including one named Newt. <br>
             Six weeks later, Newt's teenage cousin Robin, a dealer herself, <br>
             is nearly robbed by customers seeking Power. She is rescued by NOPD Officer Frank Shaver, <br>
              one of her regular buyers. Art, a man hunting for the distributor "Biggie", tracks down Newt, <br>
               who dies after a struggle when he overdoses on Power. <br>
               Frank foils a bank robbery by a Power-enhanced thief, <br>
